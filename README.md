# Operating Systems – Project Collection

## Overview
This repository contains completed projects from the **Operating Systems** course, covering **Windows and Linux system analysis, process management, memory allocation, threading, and scripting**. Each project explores fundamental OS concepts through hands-on implementation and system analysis.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Operating Systems**: Windows 10, Ubuntu Linux
- **Languages & Shells**: Bash, PowerShell, C++, Python
- **System Analysis Tools**: `perfmon`, `taskmgr`, `htop`, `top`, `vmstat`
- **Development Environments**: Visual Studio, Linux Terminal
- **Concurrency Control**: Python `threading`, synchronization mechanisms

---

## Windows 10 System Analysis
Explored **Windows system internals** through **command-line tools and performance monitoring**.

- **Analyzed system performance** using `perfmon` and `taskmgr`
- **Executed system commands** (`cd`, `dir`, `find`, `where`) to navigate files and directories
- **Examined CPU scheduling and memory management**
- **Tested network diagnostics** (`ping`, `tracert`) to observe packet routing
- **Studied process prioritization** and its impact on system resources

✔️ Successfully **monitored system behavior** under different workloads  
✔️ **Compared system data reporting** across multiple tools  

---

## Linux Command Line & Shell Scripting
Gained **practical experience** in **Linux system commands, scripting, and process management**.

- **Executed essential commands** (`ls`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `chmod`, `cat`)
- **Monitored system performance** (`htop`, `vmstat`, `free`, `df`)
- **Analyzed process states and scheduling** in Linux
- **Developed shell scripts** for automating file processing and sorting

✔️ Built **custom shell scripts** for **automation tasks**  
✔️ **Explored Linux system behavior** through **command-line experiments**  

---

## Memory Management & Allocation
Developed **a C++ program** to analyze **memory allocation limits** in different configurations.

- **Allocated memory dynamically** until reaching system limits
- **Compared memory usage** between **32-bit vs. 64-bit architectures**
- **Examined virtual memory effects** using system monitors
- **Measured performance impact** of **Large Address Aware (LAA) settings**

✔️ Successfully **identified memory allocation constraints** under different conditions  
✔️ **Documented system behavior** when handling memory-intensive applications  

---

## Process Management & Thread Synchronization
Implemented **multi-threaded applications** in Python, focusing on **synchronization and concurrency control**.

- **Explored thread scheduling** and CPU utilization in multi-threaded environments
- **Implemented the Readers-Writers problem** using thread locks and semaphores
- **Ensured proper thread synchronization** to prevent race conditions

✔️ Developed **thread-safe applications** using proper synchronization mechanisms  
✔️ **Tested concurrency issues** in a controlled OS environment
